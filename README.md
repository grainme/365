## studying compilers every day.

## day 03
- Switch back to java; because apparently it's not easy to read the book, understand the concepts and deal with C shenanigans.
- jlox is the language i'm implementing, it's a scripting language, which means it executes directly from source.

## day 02
- i'm not very good at coding in C; i might need some time to refresh my memory on this "empty" language :)
- start implementing the scanner. "Scanning" or "lexing: lexical analysis" is the first step in any compiler or interpreter.

# day 01
- prepare resources 
- setup the git repo
